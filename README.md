What I have learned doing the first part of this Google project is that 
I was able to create 
	* a directory using $ mkdir the_odin_project
	* a new repository on github called google-homepage
	* making the repository "google-homepage" local on my machine with 
	the command $ git clone git@github.com:RomanTeen1/google-homepage.git
	* then changing the directory using $ cd the_odin_project/google-homepage/
	* then create a README.md file by typing $touch README.md
	* To check if the file was created either check the file manager
	or use $ ls in the terminal to list the files that are in the directory
	including ones that you just created.
Note*: SSH key was already created in previous slides on github.
 
--I have finally finished my Google project. I only worked on the first assignment which was suppose to be
the easiest project. For me it took the whole day, but at least I was able to finish it and feel proud that 
I have used the tools that I have learned / acquired through Free Code Camp.

Note*: Even though I have finished the Google project (Assignment 1) I am completely aware that there are 
still functional problems. For example if You or I were to open up my project to preview it will look disoriented, because of the different screen dimensions. On my laptop which I used to program, It looks good because of the screen dimension I worked on was 1366 X 768 with a display orientation on Landscape.
